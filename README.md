UICheckbox is a control designed to look much like the checkmark Apple uses in iOS's photos app.

You can add this to a view control and hook it up in the same way you might expect any other UIControl to be hooked up.

The control makes use of Xcode 6's IBInspectable and IBDesignable properties so that run-time properties can be set at design time and a live preview of the control can be drawn in your interface builder so you will know exactly what to expect when you actually compile and run your application.
